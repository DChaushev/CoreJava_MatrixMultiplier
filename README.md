CoreJava_MatrixMultiplier
=========================

This is one of the tasks for Core Java Course I am attending at the university.

This application must read two matrices from binary files, multiply them and write the result to third file.<br/>
The matrices are very large (1000x1000).<br/>
There must be two versions of multiplications - single threaded and multithreaded.
